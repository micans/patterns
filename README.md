# patterns
Drawings / tilings / patterns generally written in PostScript

Wall: finished pieces.
Many use library code but it often gets messier towards the end. The drawing is
the end result of a quest for something; I usually neglect to tidy up after the
goal has been reached.

lib: re-usable PostScript code. Attributions are given at the top of files.

bin: helper scripts of all sorts.

ci: Circle inversions.

minkowski: Minkowski island fractals.
